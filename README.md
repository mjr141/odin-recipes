# odin-recipes

A simple recipe website.

Goal of the project is to build basic HTML chops, working with text, images, and links. Also getting a feel for basic styling with CSS.

Extra tips and tricks learned along the way:

- using HTML entities to display vulgar fractions eg. `&fract14;`
- using UTF-8 diacritical marks to add accents to letters eg. `e&#769`
- improving workflow with list elements: using multiple cursors in VSCode along with the *Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation* command to enclose multiple lines with tags
- making a web project directly accessible with GitHub Pages (accessible in repo settings)
